##Data Communication Based on 3G ModuleThis is a project for my bachelor degree thesis. I used two Huawei MC509 chips, which is CDMA2000 module that can transmit data and send short message via public 3G network. I wrote the program to control the chip for data communication purpose.![pic](https://github.com/liangyue268/Data-Communication/raw/master/mc509.jpg)You can see a demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYo0BU2cGqE).
